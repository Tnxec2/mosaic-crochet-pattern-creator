## Loading and Saving Patterns

You can save your pattern locally on your PC as a JSON file.

You can load this file later.

## Exporting Patterns

You can export your pattern as:

- PNG image
- Image as a PDF page (for programs that can only open PDF files)
- Textual pattern as a PDF
- Textual pattern as HTML (You can edit this HTML in other programs)

Here you can specify the file name, font size, and scaling factor.

## Importing an Image into a Pattern

You can upload an image to create a basic mosaic pattern. You can then adjust the colors and refine the design manually.

Tips:

- Use simple, high-contrast images for optimal results.
- More complex images usually require manual post-processing after conversion.

First, select the image you want to load.


You can then change various options:

- Crop borders
- Colors
- Size

## Draw patterns

There are two modes:

- Full-screen view
- You see the entire pattern at once.
- Pattern section (viewport)
- You see only a portion of the pattern. You can split the view into two areas.

## Pop-up menu
